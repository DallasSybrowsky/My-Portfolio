# Portfolio
Homework 2: Given the User Story and Acceptance Criteria below I created a portfolio of my work as a web developer. 

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

    * WHEN I load their portfolio
    * THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about 
      them, their work, and how to contact them

    * WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

    * WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    * THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

    * WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    * THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

    * WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    * THEN I am taken to that deployed application

    * WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    * THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Homework
Background:  I created the HTML to suit the layout example we were given in the homework README. I also created the CSS file to ensure the style and content of the page fit the acceptance criteria.

Note: In order to make the grading and feedback process easier I added comments in certain areas to increase clarity of the code in both HTML and CSS. 

Below are details on the methods I used to accomplish each of the items in the Acceptance Criteria:

    * My portfolio contains my name, a recent portrait, a navigation bar with links to sections about me, 
      my work, and ways to contact me.

    * The links in the navigation bar are active and when clicked, the UI scrolls to the appropriate part of 
      the page.

    * The link in the navigation bar for my work (titled 'Projects' in my webpage) scrolls the UI
      to the Projects section of my webpage.

    * The first application link is larger than subsequent links, and links to the live webpage it references.

    * The link images for other applications direct the user to placeholder webpages that will be updated as 
      more projects are completed. The placeholder webpages are basic, but let the  user know that further updates are pending.

    * The webpage is adaptive to various screen sizes, and changes format to suit various display sizes. 

## Link
Here is a link to the live site: https://dallassybrowsky.github.io/My-Portfolio/
